# Spire.Test
This is a sample project requested by the Spire support team, which cannot reproduce an issue I am facing. See: https://www.e-iceblue.com/forum/post53760.html

The Spire.Office library is used with a standard Excel file downloaded from the internet. It is throwing an exception and the support team have asked me to create a repro, which many would consider me doing their work, so I am letting the public decide.

This proves that the library cannot convert the Excel document with version 8.9.3 in trial mode.
